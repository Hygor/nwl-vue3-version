# nwl-vue3-version
A Vue3 version of the project created for the NextLevelWeek 9 (eSports)

This is a platform created in one week for training purposes. The original project was built with React and React-Native. The idea of the transcription of the project into Vue3 is to provide a good hint on how framework agnostic we can be. 

This project is a platform to find the perfect partner to play your favorite game together by connecting your Twitch.tv account, and it's not fully functional.
